# Professional Headshot Generator

Instructions for creating a professional headshot from a casual photo using AI image generators (like Midjourney or DALL-E) or editing tools.

## The Prompt

_Note: This prompt is designed for Image Generation models that accept image inputs (Image-to-Image)._

```markdown
I have attached a photo of myself. Please use this as a reference to generate a professional LinkedIn headshot.

**Style & Atmosphere:**

-   **Lighting**: Soft, studio-quality lighting (Rembrandt lighting).
-   **Background**: Blurred modern office or neutral solid color (light grey or soft blue).
-   **Attire**: Professional business casual (e.g., blazer, button-down shirt).
-   **Expression**: Approachable, confident, and smiling.
-   **Composition**: Head and shoulders, facing the camera.

**Technical Reference:**

-   Keep facial features consistent with the uploaded photo.
-   Ensure high resolution and realistic skin texture.
```

## Tips

-   For text-only models, describe your features in detail instead of "attached photo".
-   Mentioning "8k resolution", "photorealistic", and "cinematic lighting" helps.

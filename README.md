## How to use

I group things together. In each folder you'll find markdown files with more details and the prompt.
**Always** consider adjusting the prompt to your liking needs. Stuff that should be adjusted for sure are marked with `{hint}`.

## Have fun

If you enjoy these things, consider sharing and check back as this is growing. 👋

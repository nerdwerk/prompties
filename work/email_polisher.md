# Email Polisher

Rewrite emails to be more professional, persuasive, or concise.

## The Prompt

```markdown
I have a draft of an email that needs polishing. I want you to rewrite it to be {hint: e.g., more professional, friendlier, more persuasive, concise}.

Context:

-   **Recipient**: {hint: e.g., A client, my boss, a colleague}
-   **Goal**: {hint: e.g., Get approval, apologize for delay, schedule a meeting}

Here is the draft:
"""
{hint: Paste your email draft here}
"""

Please provide 3 options:

1.  **Polished**: A subtle improvement.
2.  **Concise**: Short and to the point.
3.  **Alternative**: A slightly different tone (as requested).
```

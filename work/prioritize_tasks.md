# Prioritize Tasks

This prompt helps you turn a chaotic "brain dump" or a long list of to-dos into a structured, prioritized action plan.

## The Prompt

```markdown
I have a long list of tasks and ideas that I need to organize. Below is a "brain dump" of everything on my mind.

Please act as a productivity expert and help me organize this list.

1.  **Categorize** the items into logical groups (e.g., Work, Personal, project-specific).
2.  **Prioritize** them using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important).
3.  **Format** the output as a clean, checklist-style markdown table.
4.  **Identify** any items that are vague and suggest a clarifying question for them.

Here is the brain dump:
"""
{hint: Paste your brain dump here}
"""
```

## Tips

-   Be specific in your brain dump.
-   If you have deadlines, include them in the text.
